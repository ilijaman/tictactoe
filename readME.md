# Tic-Tac-Toe


PROJECT GOAL: 



The goal with this project was to create a simple 3 by 3 square tic-tac-toe game.

Whilst creating this, there were important factors to consider, i.e. a tile cannot repeatedly be used, players must take turns, situations must be created for a win/draw, and a restart button must be functioning to reset the board etc... 



TECHNOLOGIES/ LANGUAGES USED:



After committing the finalised project to Github the language breakdown was shown to be ~50% CCS, 40% JS, 10 % HTML. Extra effort went into incorporating different themes to make the page/game feel less bland... this was done predominantly through CSS. 

CSS grid was used to compartmentalise different sections of the page, i.e. create a left and right side player panel, whilst retaining the board to stay fixed in the middle of them both. 




WHAT DID YOU LEARN?


Being in only my third week of coding and having never worked on any sort of programming project before meant that there were fundamental lessons learned.  

I learned that tampering with already created code is going to create a lot of bugs and there are lots of considerations that must be in your mind when adjusting ready-made functions etc.

In saying this, I also learned of how important and valuable it is to regularly commit and push any changes that are being made. 

I also learned the importance of planning and breaking down a project like this into digestible/ smaller segments. I found it jarring at the start trying to figure out too many things at once, workflow gained speed and direction as tasks were broken up to mini-goals. 



PROBLEMS/ HURDLES IN THE PROJECT: 



The first problem I encountered was being stuck staring at a blank VS-Code not knowing how to start the project. When considering all the fucntionality that needs to be implemented it became daunting staring at a screen that didn't provide a walkthrough/step-by-step process (which is what made the initial 2 weeks of coding feel easier.) 

The first step I took was wire-framing/ and designing a blueprint for the page on a4 paper. After this, I went to CSS grid to design the layout for the page. 

Once this was complete I moved onto the JS to begin tackling the functionality tasks. Not knowing how to start the Javascript was probably one of the biggest barriers I encountered. As previously stated, trying to achieve just one thing to start off with, i.e. Simply developing a click event to display only X's in the tiles, is what got the ball rolling for me. 

A few difficulties/setbacks:

- Developing an end-game condition and making sure it fires off the correct response of win/draw at the right moments.
- Figuring out how to change the X's and O's to images, then formulating a method to make sure images are theme specific. 
- Figuring out how to make the restart button remove images and not just X's, O's.
- Figuring out how to display a dynamic image of the winner in the pop-up screen.




SOMETHING THAT I MIGHT ADD IN THE FUTURE



- Ability to choose characters... which in turn would lead to the respective chosen character being displayed as the X/O token on the board, as well as on the winnings pop-up screen. 
- AI Functionality so that you can play the game against the computer. 
- A Nav bar in CSS.
